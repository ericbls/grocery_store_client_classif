This is a short project to classify different clients from a brazilian grocery supermarket into different profiles. In this project the original dataset is analysed to find initial concluions and insights.

After the first data analysis, new columns and a few regularization of the dataset are required, so it can be inputed in the unsupervised machine learning pipeline.

Finally, different segmentations were created to classify each client into different profiles.
